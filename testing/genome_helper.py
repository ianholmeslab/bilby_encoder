def generate_gene(splice_structure: list[int]) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Generates a "realistic" gene sequence with intron and exon regions based on a specified 
    structure.

    This function simulates a gene sequence by generating nucleotide sequences for introns 
    and exons according to a given structure. Introns are flanked by canonical "GT...AG" splice 
    sites. Exons are included both in the full gene sequence and in a separate "read" sequence 
    containing only exons.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    splice_structure : list of int
        A list of integers representing the lengths of consecutive intron and exon segments.
        The list should have an odd number of elements, starting and ending with exon lengths.
        Exon lengths are given by elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...),
        and intron lengths by elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

    Returns:
    -------
    tuple of (str, str)
        - gene_sequence: A string representing the nucleotide sequence of the gene, 
          including introns and exons.
        - exon_sequence: A string representing the nucleotide sequence of the exons 
          only (the "read").

    Raises:
    ------
    ValueError
        If the length of `splice_structure` is not odd, if any exon length (elements at even 
        indices) is less than 1 nucleotide, or if any intron length (elements at odd indices)
        is less than 4 nucleotides.

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> generate_gene([5, 6, 3])

    Notes:
    -----
    - Each intron is generated with a minimum length of 4 nucleotides, and is flanked by "GT" 
      and "AG" to represent canonical splice donor and acceptor sites.
    - Exon sequences are directly appended to the "exon_sequence", while both introns and exons 
      are added to the full "gene_sequence".
    - The output is randomized, so nucleotide sequences will differ on each function call.
